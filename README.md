## General information

Original author of examples is [Mark McGranaghan](https://github.com/mmcgrana) from Seattle, WA.

I'd like to retype his examples myself to memorize it better.

I left it Public, because I made some small changes to some of original examples just to learn myself, perhaps, someone finds it useful.

Original examples are nicely displayed at this website: [https://gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com)

It's repository located here: [https://github.com/mmcgrana/gobyexample](https://github.com/mmcgrana/gobyexample)
